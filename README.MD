This is a membership site built with Node JS, Express, Mongoose and Tailwind CSS. 

Users are anonymous to each other, unless they acquire Speakeasy membership by answering a riddle correctly after creating an account. 

Users can sign in as a guests, but to be a true member, they have to know the secret password.

Once users become members of the Speakeasy, they can see the names and profile pics of other members. 

The site uses Passport to authenticate users.
