It turns out that you can pass data to an EJS partial just like a React component.
For example,

<%- include('partials/somefile', {data: data })%>

In a Node JS app, when you need an html form to return an array to the backend once the 
form is submitted, you cannot pass the array from an html input element. Instead, you 
need to convert the array into a JSON string first, in which it can converted back into
an array in the backend with JSON.parse()

For example, in the user profile form, links are stored in the array AddedSocialArray.
The values of that array needs to be passed  to a hidden input in the form. Do the following:


    <div 
        id ="SocialMediaFormWrapper"
        class = "grid grid-cols-[90%_10%]" 
        >

var SocialHiddenInput = document.getElementById('SocialHiddenInput');

//Everytime you need to update SocialHiddenInput, execute the following

SocialHiddenInput.value=JSON.stringify(AddedSocialArray)

//Once the form has been submitted, SocialHiddenInput will send the data in form of JSON string

//In the backend, run the following:

        var updates = {
            SocialMediaLinks: JSON.parse(req.body.NewSocialMediaLinks), 
        }

//JSON.parse(req.body.NewSocialMediaLinks) returns an array

To deal with issues of escaped string content, use the library 'he' to unescape the string.

Social media icons are stored with the array:
SocialMediaLinks

Sample 
SocialMedialinks = [
	    {   
            platform: "facebook", 
            link: "facebook.com"
        },
        {
            platform: "instagram",
            link: "instagram.com"
        },
        {
            platform: "youtube",
            link: "youtube.com"
        },
        {
            platform: "website",
            link: "www.ladesigninitiative.com"
]
